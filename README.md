# Pterodactle
Pterodactle is a fun wordle-based dinosaur guessing game.

## Gameplay
Simply enter a guess and see which categories you got right and which ones you got wrong. The categories include name, diet, time period, country, type, and length. Use this information from previous guesses to narrow down the options and guess the correct dinosaur!

Begin by inputting your first guess into the box. As you type letters, a dropdown will appear with all the possible dinosaurs you may be trying to type. For example, typing "ab" will result in all dinosaurs in the dataset starting with those letters to appear. A dinosaur in the dropdown can be clicked, or its name can be typed out. Either the enter key or the "Submit" button can be clicked. If the value in the textbox that is submitted is not a dinosaur name in the dataset, it will be deleted from the textbox and the guess will have to be re-written. Once you guess, all correct categories will be colored green, while all incorrect categories will be colored gray. You will have infinite guesses to guess the correct dinosaur. Once you succeed, a "You Win!" popup will appear with the number of guesses you took and the correct dinosaur. There will also be a "Practice" button, where you can play practice mode.
